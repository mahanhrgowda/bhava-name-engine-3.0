Bh캐va Name Engine 3.0
游꺚 A Streamlit web application that maps a name to its emotive essence (Bh캐va), Chakra, and Rasa using Sanskrit phonetics, and explores associated Vedic Devas and Siddhi powers.
Overview
The Bh캐va Name Engine 3.0 is an interactive tool inspired by Sanskrit phonetics, Rasa theory, and Vedic wisdom. It takes a name as input and provides:

Siddhi Skill Web: Showcases Siddhi powers (e.g., Mahim캐, A攷im캐) associated with the Chakras, including practices, mantras, and benefits.

The app is designed for spiritual enthusiasts, yogis, and those interested in Vedic and Sanskrit traditions.
